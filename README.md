Steps to implement my project:
1. Clone the Repository: 

•	Open Git Bash (or any other terminal).

•	Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

•	Run the command: https://github.com/shrush11/MWA-Project.git

2. Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

•	Navigate to the cloned repository directory in VS Code.

•	Open the terminal in VS Code.

3. Set Up MySQL Database:

•	Install MySQL if not already installed and ensure the MySQL service is running.

•	Open a MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, command-line interface).

•	Create a database named "project" or use your preferred database name.

•	Import the provided SQL script to create necessary tables and schema.

4. Install Node.js Dependencies:

•	In the terminal, navigate to the root directory of your project.

•	Run the following command to install required Node.js dependencies: npm install

5. Run the Node.js Server:

•	In the terminal, run the following command to start the Node.js server: node server.js

6. Starting the website

•	Open the provided `login.js` file in the terminal.

•	Run the command: node login.js

•	This will execute the login script and test the login functionality.

7. Access the Website Locally:

•	Open a web browser.

•	Type the following URL in the address bar: localhost:portno

•	Replace "portno" with the port number specified in your server configuration.

•	Navigate through the website pages (e.g., "localhost:portno/ final index.html", "localhost:portno/login.html") to interact with the website.

8. Troubleshooting and Debugging:

•	If you encounter any errors during the setup or execution, carefully review the error messages and check your configuration settings.

•	Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly and that your MySQL database connection details are accurate.

•	I've included a helpful instructional video demonstrating the steps to run the website seamlessly, ensuring smooth implementation for all users.
